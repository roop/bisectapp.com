## Contact

Hi. I'm [Roopesh Chander][], and I work on Bisect and other apps
as an indpendent developer.

I'm a big fan of both Markdown and the iPad, and wrote Bisect as a way
to make it easy to write blog posts and essays on the iPad.

I welcome your feedback on Bisect. You can provide feedback in any of
the following ways:

  - E-mail: bisect@roopc.net
  - Twitter: [@bisectapp][]
